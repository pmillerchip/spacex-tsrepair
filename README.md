## MPEG-TS repair software for the SpaceX CRS-3 video repair task

This software was written in May 2014 to process the corrupted CRS-3
landing video posted by SpaceX: [SpaceX's page](http://www.spacex.com/news/2014/04/29/first-stage-landing-video)

I originally posted it on the nasaspaceflight.com forum [here](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=34597.msg1205369#msg1205369)
and that message explains in detail how to use it.

The software was written quickly in order to get results as fast as we
could, so the quality isn't great and it is tailored specifically to
the SpaceX video file. Don't use this as an example of good code!
